# Hey there, I'm Stufflyer — a Passionate Builder of Worlds, Minds, and Machines!

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a curious and creative developer who thrives at the intersection of **game design**, **AI simulation**, and **low-level systems**. Whether it's simulating civilizations in Roblox, crafting custom programming languages, or building 3D engines in C++, I'm always exploring new frontiers in tech.

## 🔧 What I Do

![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=StufflyerScripting&layout=compact)


### Game Development
- **Roblox Creator**: I’ve built unique experiences like:
  - A 3D Gartic Phone game with synchronized teleport/build mechanics.
  - “Don’t Touch the Computer” – a chaos-fueled minigame of computer-triggered events.
  - Civilization simulators where tiny humans evolve in a player-modified world.
  - Strategy and PvP games with construction, sabotage, and tower warfare.
- **Procedural Generation Fan**: I’ve coded random cities, urbex maps, and Lego Worlds-style terrain.
### System-Level (Engineering
- **C++ Developer**: With a love for bitwise logic and performance.
  - Created a fully customizable **chess engine** ("Mooncat") with bitboards and FEN parsing.
  - Working on a **Rubik’s Cube simulator**, both 2D and 3D, using OpenGL + GLFW + GLAD.
- **I LOVE OPEN GL**

### Custom Languages & Tools
- **X# & XASM**: Assembly-like languages for a Minecraft-style CPU with pixel-based outputs.
  - Simulates memory, screen buffers, and custom control flow.
  - Developing a full **VSCode extension** with syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and error checking.

## 🧠 My Interests

- **Game AI**: Simulating intelligence and evolution in self-contained worlds.
- **Brain Simulation**: My dream project—modeling neurons and cognition with code.
- **Computer Architecture**: Designing CPUs and low-level systems from scratch.
- **Rubik’s Cube**: Expert-level solver and simulator developer.
- **Biotech, Space, and AI**: Especially how they're coded and simulated in virtual environments.
- **Procedural Terrains**: These are so cool! Creating magic terrains with just code!
